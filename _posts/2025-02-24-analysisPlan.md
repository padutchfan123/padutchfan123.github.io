Pre-planning an analysis in the manner of our Gerrymandering Case Study, which utilizes a research compendium with detailed contents for organization, can be beneficial to researchers, as it forces them to more closely understand their data before analysis, and to be more mindful in how they approach working with the data in order to avoid potential sources of error.

This approach also helps to front-load work documenting metadata and explanation of code that the researchers would need to do later before publishing their research. Pre-planning an analysis ensures that subsequent code can be more legible to other researchers and more intentional in general.
